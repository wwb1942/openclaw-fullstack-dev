# openclaw-fullstack-dev

An OpenClaw AgentSkill for building, refactoring, and reviewing full-stack applications with a workflow that favors explicit architecture decisions, thin end-to-end slices, real verification, and clean handoff.

## What this skill is for

Use `openclaw-fullstack-dev` when an agent needs to handle multi-step full-stack work such as:

- building a CRUD app with frontend + backend
- adding auth flows, uploads, or realtime features
- deciding between monolith, split frontend/backend, or API-only shapes
- debugging across UI, server, and database boundaries
- refactoring an existing full-stack codebase into a safer MVP path

The skill is designed to keep agents from jumping straight into code without first clarifying scope, choosing project shape, and defining a verification plan.

## Core workflow

1. Normalize the request into a concrete implementation target
2. Choose project shape and stack defaults
3. State architecture decisions before major coding
4. Build the thinnest end-to-end slice first
5. Expand feature-by-feature in vertical slices
6. Verify build, runtime, and integration
7. Hand off with commands, changed files, assumptions, and gaps

## Practical resources included

### 1. Kickoff plan script

Generate a structured first-pass plan before coding:

```bash
python3 openclaw-fullstack-dev/scripts/generate_fullstack_plan.py \
  "Build an internal feedback tracker with Next.js, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL" \
  --frontend nextjs \
  --backend fastapi \
  --db postgres
```

### 2. Stack guides

- `references/stack-nextjs-fastapi.md`
- `references/stack-react-express.md`
- `references/stack-nextjs-nestjs.md`

These provide sane defaults for project shape, first vertical slice, implementation notes, and verification commands.

### 3. Starter templates

This repo includes copyable starter templates under `openclaw-fullstack-dev/assets/`:

- `nextjs-fastapi-starter`
- `react-express-starter`
- `nextjs-nestjs-starter`

Copy one into a working directory with:

```bash
python3 openclaw-fullstack-dev/scripts/copy_starter_template.py --list
python3 openclaw-fullstack-dev/scripts/copy_starter_template.py nextjs-fastapi-starter /tmp/my-app
```

Then run a deterministic skeleton check:

```bash
python3 openclaw-fullstack-dev/scripts/verify_starter_template.py nextjs-fastapi-starter /tmp/my-app
```

### 4. Build-verified template status

These templates were not only copied and structurally verified, but also exercised with real install/build checks:

- `nextjs-fastapi-starter`
  - Next.js client: `npm install && npm run build` ✅
  - FastAPI server: dependency install + live `/health` check ✅
  - Starter UI now includes a real create + list browser flow
- `react-express-starter`
  - React client: `npm install && npm run build` ✅
  - Express server: `npm install && npm run build` + live `/health` check ✅
  - Starter UI now includes a real create + list browser flow
- `nextjs-nestjs-starter`
  - Next.js client: `npm install && npm run build` ✅
  - NestJS server: `npm install && npm run build` + live `/health` check ✅
  - Starter UI now includes a real create + list browser flow

The goal is not to claim production completeness, but to prove the starters are materially closer to runnable than placeholder scaffolds.

### 5. Demo task

See `references/demo-task.md` for a concrete example request, normalized target, kickoff command, and completion expectations.

## Repository quickstart

```bash
# 1) run helper tests
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v

# 2) generate a kickoff plan
python3 openclaw-fullstack-dev/scripts/generate_fullstack_plan.py \
  "Build an internal feedback tracker with Next.js, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL" \
  --frontend nextjs \
  --backend fastapi \
  --db postgres

# 3) copy and inspect a starter
python3 openclaw-fullstack-dev/scripts/copy_starter_template.py nextjs-fastapi-starter /tmp/my-app
python3 openclaw-fullstack-dev/scripts/verify_starter_template.py nextjs-fastapi-starter /tmp/my-app

# 4) package a distributable skill artifact
OPENCLAW_ROOT="$(npm root -g)/openclaw"
python3 "$OPENCLAW_ROOT/skills/skill-creator/scripts/package_skill.py" ./openclaw-fullstack-dev ./dist
```

Use this repo in two modes:

- **source mode**: iterate on `SKILL.md`, references, scripts, and starter assets directly
- **distribution mode**: ship `dist/openclaw-fullstack-dev.skill` as the packaged artifact

## Continuous validation

GitHub Actions now runs four layers of validation:

- helper unit tests for the deterministic Python scripts
- helper script checks (`generate_fullstack_plan.py`, template copy, structural verification)
- starter smoke builds for all three included stacks
- live backend `/health` smoke checks plus packaged `.skill` generation

See `.github/workflows/validate.yml`.

## Packaging

Before packaging, keep the skill tree clean: remove local `node_modules/`, `.next/`, and starter `dist/` build output so the distributable artifact only contains source files.

Rebuild the `.skill` package with:

```bash
OPENCLAW_ROOT="$(npm root -g)/openclaw"
python3 "$OPENCLAW_ROOT/skills/skill-creator/scripts/package_skill.py" ./openclaw-fullstack-dev ./dist
```

## Design goals

This skill intentionally pushes agents toward:

- explicit assumptions
- architecture before implementation
- smallest viable end-to-end slice first
- verification before confidence
- concise but operational handoff
- copying a starter only when it genuinely helps
- using deterministic checks before claiming a template is ready

## Status

Current version: practical v1+ with workflow guidance, starter resources, boilerplate templates, and template verification helpers.
